# My Utilities

Repository of tools scripts that I use to make my life easier. When I make one that could help others, I will post them here. 
I don't guarantee any kind of support or feature enhancements. I hope it'll help a few people.

## Magento 2.x

* **Bulk delete images linked to skus**: Magento / Adobe Commerce has no built-in feature to bulk delete images linked to skus (example: you want to replace a logo on 20 different items i.e. delete the existing image and replace it with a new one). The script reads a list of skus in delete_skus_images.csv, unlink the images and delete them for you.
