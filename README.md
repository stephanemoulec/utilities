### Bulk Delete Product Images by SKU for Magento / Adobe Commerce

Python utility script for Magento / Adobe Commerce that automates the removal of media gallery images linked to specific SKUs. Ideal for sysadmins and developers managing product catalogs at scale, the script reads a list of SKUs from a CSV file, unlinks all associated images via the Magento REST API, and deletes them. This is especially useful for bulk cleanup tasks like replacing outdated logos or correcting import errors.
